# Gcal-to-sheet
Obtenga su calendario de Google, incluidas las funciones profesionales detr√°s de una hoja, usando Apps Script

I upload the document as .gs extension because is used like that.
1. Open an Excel Sheet in Google Drive
2. In the menu of your sheet go to Extensions and then AppsScript
3. Open My G-cal pro.txt in notepad, select all and copy, then return to your AppsScript behind your Sheet and paste this code 
4. The last thing you need to do to see it working is change "youremail@gmail.com" for your email account, and choose the dates you want to achieve.

I hope you like it and result you useful. The result should seem like in the photo. If you want the colors, you need to check the colors are activated in your google calendar events.
