# Gcal-to-sheet
Obtenga su calendario de Google, incluidas las funciones profesionales detr√°s de una hoja, usando Apps Script

I upload the document as .gs extension because is used like that.
1. Open an Excel Sheet in Google Drive
2. In the menu of your sheet go to Extensions and then AppsScript
3. Open My G-cal pro.txt in notepad, select all and copy, then return to your AppsScript behind your Sheet and paste this code
4. On AppScript choose the function you prefer. If you want only the content of your principal calendar then run the function "traerCalendarioprincipal". If you want all the most complete as you can, as me, run the function "traertodoslosCalendarios"
5. The last thing you need to do to see it working is change "youremail@gmail.com", for your email account, and choose the dates you want to achieve.

Don't forget to delete the content and the colors on the sheet each time you run the function

I hope you like it and result you useful. The result should seem like in the photo. If you want the colors, you need to check the colors are activated in your google calendar events.
